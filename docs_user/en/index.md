Email marketing is a highly effective way to generate repeat business from your existing customers,
and those who have opted-in to your newsletter mailing list. 

You should always provide a link for users to click. Make sure you provide persuasive, compelling content and images that makes the recipient
want to take the action of clicking a link.

Make use of images in your newsletter template and content. This encourages recipients to enable images for that email, and therefore
provides you with confirmation that the email has been opened. If you make sure there are noticeable gaps where images should be, then
the recipient is more likely to enable images.

An email will also be confirmed as opened if the recipient clicks a link.
